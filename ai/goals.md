## Initial Goals
- [ ] Set up a Vite + TypeScript project for web-based VR development.
- [ ] Integrate a VR framework (e.g., Three.js or A-Frame).
- [ ] Create a basic interactive VR scene as a starting point.
- [ ] Set up automated deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Ensure VR and non-VR fallback works on all supported devices.
- [ ] Refine person model for anatomical accuracy and visual appeal.

## How to Use This File
- Add, update, or check off goals as the project progresses.g
- Use Markdown formatting for sections, lists, and checkboxes.

## Feature Ideas

- Multiplayer support
- Resource management system
- Base building mechanics
- VR-specific controls and UI
- AI opponents
- Fog of war
- Tech tree and upgrades

- Player ability: drop boulders (large rocks) to block enemy paths and create temporary barriers
- Environmental ability: summon weather or cloud cover to block enemy vision (dynamic fog/clouds affecting line-of-sight)
- Gameplay mechanic: VR training mini-game where the player performs physical VR movements to 'train' or temporarily boost unit stats (e.g., execute reload motions to increase a mortar's fire-rate)

- Cinematic/interactive defeat scene: when the player is losing, trigger a scene where an NPC warns the player and the player can 'flip the table' (physically in VR) to cause environmental destruction; instead of a score, the losing player receives a temporary comeback boost (for example: resource surge, unit repair, or a short buff) to help even the game
