# Project Goals

This file outlines the main goals and objectives for the web-based VR game project. All goals are written in English and formatted using Markdown for clarity.

The main goal is to make a Web based VR Real Time Strategy game.
For human ease of use, this project should always automate setup processes and provide clear explanations when errors occur and how to address those errors.
The project structure should be well organized - leading a new user to understand how and where to make a change without too much digging/research.

## Feature Ideas

- Add a ui menu for starting or loading an existing game - as well as other miscellanious settings
- Multiplayer support
- Resource management system
- Base building mechanics
- VR-specific controls and UI
- AI opponents
- Fog of war
- Tech tree and upgrades
- Player ability: drop boulders (large rocks) to block enemy paths and create temporary barriers
- Environmental ability: summon weather or cloud cover to block enemy vision (dynamic fog/clouds affecting line-of-sight)
- Gameplay mechanic: VR training mini-game where the player performs physical VR movements to 'train' or temporarily boost unit stats (e.g., execute reload motions to increase a mortar's fire-rate)
- Cinematic/interactive defeat scene: when the player is losing, trigger a scene where an NPC warns the player and the player can 'flip the table' (physically in VR) to cause environmental destruction; instead of a score, the losing player receives a temporary comeback boost (for example: resource surge, unit repair, or a short buff) to help even the game
